			<p>
				I hope that your October has gone well!
				Colorado has gone through quite a beautiful transformation; 
				the leaves seemed to catch fire, and suddenly were replaced by snow and ice.
				I feel that this explosion of beauty expresses well the outpouring of blessings
				God has given to my mission this month in particular!
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you for your prayers for the men's camping retreat at the start of this month!
				We spent the weekend in beautiful Buena Vista, CO with about 10 cadets having great conversations
				and fun adventures. Our chaplain also came by to celebrate mass for us at our campsite!
			</p>
			<p>
				This month we have been putting lots of work into inviting the cadets from our events
				and bible studies to SEEK, the annual conference hosted by FOCUS designed to invite
				young adults to a relationship with Christ. Students have been sharing testimonies
				of their encounters with Him at the conference last year, and I am so excited
				and hopeful that many will say yes this year also! I will try to share links to some 
				of their testimonies.

				I have seen God working most clearly this month in how He has given me
				opportunities to grow closer to cadets while doing things I love.
				One day after wrapping up one of my afternoon bible studies, I was
				heading down to my car when I ran into Pete, a cadet I'm friends with.
				Pete was having a hard time because he had been looking
				forward to visiting a base in New Mexico that weekend, but because of an
				administration mistake he had been removed from the trip. At least he had
				come up with a back-up plan - he is part of the airsoft club, and they
				had a game that saturday he could go to now (airsoft is a combat game like
				paintball). I hadn't played since high school, but for about a month I had been
				dying for an opportunity to find a way to play with the USAFA club! I asked if I could
				come with him, and we had a ton of fun playing together. I'm hoping to
				join them regularly and make more friends in the club!
