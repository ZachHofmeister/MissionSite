					<p>
						And I hope you had a great Thanksgiving! I have no shortage of things to be thankful for this year, but I am especially grateful for the opportunity to be here at the academy, for all of the new friends God has blessed me with, and for your support in this mission!
					</p>
					<p>
						There has been lots going on this month! To kick things off, our team took a trip to Dallas, Texas for the Air Force vs Army football game. This was the biggest game for the academy, and it was very fun experiencing the victory there in person with cadets we knew! We also got to explore Dallas Fort Worth area with them.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next week, my parents visited me for an early birthday celebration. I enjoyed getting to spend time with them and also showing them what my life looks like here!
					</p>
					<p>
						Lastly, I stayed in the springs for Thanksgiving week and got to spend time with my teammate Mikayla and two cadets who also stayed in town. To celebrate, the four of us made a great Thanksgiving dinner, put up Christmas decorations, played board games, and went to the movie theater together!

						Advent is here, which means Christmas will be here before we know it! Advent is a great time to celebrate the truth that the Lord is coming, and also to prepare a place in our hearts for Him. As the semester comes to a close, I have been praying about the ways that I can give more of my heart and my life to the Lord, and also preparing to personally invite the students in my bible studies to do the same. Please pray for them to accept this invitation! I hope that you have a happy and blessed Advent, and I'd love to hear about any ways that you are preparing during this season too!
