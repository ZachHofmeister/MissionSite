					<h2 class="italic">Hello Again!</h2>
					<p>
						Happy Fall! I'm excited to share some of my highlights from this past month with you!
					</p>
					<p>
						First, we had our freshmen retreat at the end of August which went so well! My favorite part of the retreat was being on a prayer team with Zion, a senior cadet, and getting to pray with students who came to us for prayers during Adoration. I also saw God working when I was able to help a freshman who was going through a tough time that I happened to sit next to on the bus trip home.
					</p>
					<p>
						Football season started at the beginning of September, which I am enjoying since we didn't have a football team at my college! We tailgated before the first home game and invited cadets to come play games and have donuts with us. The first game was also during parents weekend, so we enjoyed meeting some of the cadets families also. So far, we are 2-1 and won both of our home games by a mile!

					<p>
						The joy of leading a bible study for the first time last year was a big part of why I wanted to become a missionary, and it has been so good to invite people and get started with them for the semester! I think bible studies are one of the best ways to build authentic friendships that are centered on the Lord. I am leading three studies for freshmen and sophomores examining big questions like why did God create us, what did Jesus' death accomplish, and what does He want for us now, and one for juniors and seniors about how we can grow close to God through His living Word and the Church He gave to us.
