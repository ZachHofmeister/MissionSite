			<h3>Bible Studies</h3>
			<p class="text-large">
				My freshmen Bible study has been going very well this month! We are walking through <a href="https://focusequip.org/the-crux-2020/" target="_blank">The Crux</a> study, which focuses on answering important questions like "Why did God create us?", "What did Jesus' death accomplish?", and "What does He want for our lives?". It has been great to see them encounter some of these questions for the first time and walk through Scripture with them. I've also been getting lunch with them one-on-one to hear where they're at in their faith!

			<h3>Welcome Retreat</h3>
			<p class="text-large">Towards the end of the month we had the welcome retreat for the new freshmen. For the retreat we camped, enjoyed a day at a lake, prayed together and had a priest come celebrate Mass for us on Saturday night! One of the biggest blessings of the retreat for me was getting to have Gabe and Drew from my Bible study attend, even though they weren't planning on coming initially. Afterwards they both shared how they encountered God during the retreat with the group!</p>
