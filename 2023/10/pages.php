			<h3>The Gospel and Discipleship</h3>
			<p class="text-large">
				This month in Bible study we finished walking through The Crux, which is focused on presenting the Gospel. The guys have been very receptive to the call to make Christ the center of their lives, and all of them are desiring a deeper relationship with Him.

			<h3>SEEK Week</h3>
			<p class="text-large">
				This month we've also started inviting all our students to <a href="https://seek.focus.org" target="_blank">SEEK</a>, the annual conference FOCUS hosts to bring thousands of college students together each winter! Attending SEEK each year of college always proved to be a point of deeper conversion for me, and played a big role in my hearing Jesus' call to serve as a missionary. The peak of our invitations was an info party we threw at the Newman house where we shared about our experiences and helped them get signed up! We have 18 students signed up already, and our goal is to have 30 coming with us! I'm so excited to continue inviting students and helping them to be able to attend, and to see how Jesus will work in our time there!

			<h3>Gospel Highlight: Luke 12:22-34</h3>
			<p class="text-large">
				A Gospel passage I kept coming back to in prayer this month was <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+12%3A22-34&version=NABRE" target="_blank">Luke 12:22-34</a>. I was especially touched by the gentle way that Jesus invites His disciples to trust in Him more, and have been seeking to give more of my trust to His plan over mine. I invite you to spend some time with Him in this passage too!
