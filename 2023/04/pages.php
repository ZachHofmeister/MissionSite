<!-- Yours, O Lord, are the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and on the earth is yours; yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are exalted as head above all. - 1 Chronicles 29:11 -->

			<h2 class="italic">Dear Friends,</h2>
			<p>
				Christ is Risen! I hope that you had a wonderful celebration and are still filled with Easter joy throughout the season! This month has gone too fast, but God has blessed it in many ways which I'm excited to share with you!
			</p>
			<h4>Easter!</h4>
			<p>
				It was so good to reflect on the passion of our Lord and celebrate the joy of His resurrection with the cadets! We had mass on base for Holy Thursday and Good Friday, prayed and watched the Passion of the Christ together, and celebrated at the Easter Vigil! On Easter Sunday, we had fun making brunch for 200+ cadets after the morning mass! After Easter, I had some great conversations with cadets about how we can share the joy of the resurrection with others!
			</p>
			<h4>Bible Studies and Discipleship</h4>
			<p>
				We are beginning to wrap up bible studies, and my focus has been on how we can continue to respond to the call of Jesus this summer and beyond. In discipleship, Joe and I have been preparing for him to lead a bible study next year. I've also started walking with two seniors in living and sharing their faith after graduation!

			<p>
				I have some big news to share with you: next school year, FOCUS has invited me to serve at a new school, Colorado Mesa University. I was surprised by this invitation, and it's hard to think that I will be leaving my friends at the academy so soon. At the same time, I know that this isn't the end of my friendships here, and I am excited to see what new opportunities await me in Grand Junction, CO. Please pray for me to be able to finish well in these final weeks and love those that I have the opportunity to as best I can!
