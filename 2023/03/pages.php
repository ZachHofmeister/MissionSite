<!-- Yours, O Lord, are the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and on the earth is yours; yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are exalted as head above all. - 1 Chronicles 29:11 -->

			<p>
				Happy spring! I'm so thankful that it looks like we'll be getting warmer weather for Easter this weekend. I am praying that you will have a great Holy Week, and hope you enjoy this little update from the Academy!

			<h4 class="text-right">Skiing!</h4>
			<p>
				Near the beginning of March we took about 10 cadets up to Keystone for a Falcon Catholic ski day! The trip was a great opportunity to spend time with guys I don't see as much, meet new ones, and have good conversations on the road.

			<h4 class="text-right">Discipleship Updates</h4>
			<p>
				Growing Discipleship has been going well with the three guys I am walking with, and this month I will be inviting them to start learning to lead their own bible studies for next semester! I am also inviting some of the seniors to walk with me in learning how they can share their faith and build community after they graduate. Please pray for them!

			<h4 class="">Lenten Journey</h4>
			<p>
				Since January I've been walking with a small group of men in <a href="https://exodus90.com/" target="_blank">Exodus 90</a>, a 90 day spiritual exercise concluding at easter that emphasizes prayer, asceticism, and fellowship. It has been difficult and far from perfect, but has been slowly helping us to realize our attachments and offer them to our Lord. One of the cadets has especially impressed me with his dedication to praying a daily holy hour, even though he could easily justify praying less. In the Easter celebration it can be easy to abandon what we've been learning in Lent, so please pray for us! I hope you have had a fruitful Lent and will have a joyous Easter!
