			<h2 class="italic">Dear Friends,</h2>
			<p>
				I hope that you are doing well! I am excited to tell you about some of the highlights from February here at the academy!
			</p>
			<h4>Archbishop Broglio's Visit</h4>
			<p>
				Each year, the Archbishop for the Military Services makes it a priority to visit us for the baptism and confirmation of cadets entering the Church! He met lots of cadets, celebrated mass for us, and spoke at our SPIRE meeting about his recent visit to Ukraine.
			</p>
			<h4>Airsoft Outreach</h4>
			<p>
				Getting to play with the Airsoft club was an awesome answer to prayer last semester, and this semester I've been able to join for many more game days! I've been inviting cadets I'm friends with to come play also and getting to know the others who come more and more. Please pray for the members of the club that God will work in their hearts and lives and provide opportunities to share the Gospel!

				I have been having lots of good conversations in my growing discipleship meetings this month with Jared and Joe, who I mentioned last update, and I also recently started meeting with Pete! We have been discussing the four practices of the disciples in Acts 2:42 and how we can better incorporate them into our lives.
