			<p>
			What a year it has been! I hope that you've had a good summer! Thank you for your generosity in accompanying through all of the ups and downs of my first year on mission with FOCUS. In this update I'm excited to share with you how my time at the Air Force Academy finished up, my summer, and what I'm looking forward to this coming school year!
			</p>
			<h4>Leaving the Academy</h4>
			<p>
			It was very hard to say goodbye to the cadets I've grown close to over this past year, but because of that we valued the time we had left together more. Before finals, my bible studies wrapped up with a send-off talk and games, we had a party for our final SPIRE meeting, and I got to join the airsoft club for one last game. During finals week, we hosted events every day to give the cadets a break from studying. For our last hurrah after finals I planned a camping trip with 3 other guys, and got dinner with some others the evening before leaving to Nebraska for summer training!

			<h4>Summer Training</h4>
			<p>
			This year, our FOCUS summer training was hosted in Lincoln, Nebraska at UNL. We had tons of amazing classes from priests, theologians, and FOCUS veteran staff, and a lot of time for prayer and reflection on this past year. It was also very inspiring to be with my fellow missionaries and friends and to hear their experiences. After training, I am even more inspired to share the Gospel boldly this upcoming year!
			</p>
			<h4>Moving to Grand Junction</h4>
			<p>
				After training, I spent some time in California continuing to raise support, and this past week I've moved to Grand Junction where I'll be serving this year. I love this town and I've been enjoying my time with my teammate Brian! He took me on a tour of the Colorado Mesa University campus and our Newman house, and I can't wait for the rest of our team to get here and our fall outreach to start!<br>
			<!-- </p>
			<p> -->
				In the coming weeks, we will be attending a retreat as a team, preparing for the school year, and finally starting fall outreach, where we spend lots of time meeting students and inviting them into our bible studies and the CMU Catholic community! Please pray for our efforts, and I can't wait to tell you all about it!

			<h2 class="text-center">Camping Trip Story</h2>
			<p>
			My favorite time was after finals, when I went on a camping trip with Pete, Seth, and Emile. We had good conversations and fun exploring God’s creation, but the biggest blessing of the trip was finding our campsite. We checked out a couple that we had looked up in advance, but they were all closed or nonexistent. We were driving around a lake passing closed site after closed site, and I was starting to think that the trip was ruined and we’d have to go back home. Mostly just to distract myself from this, I suggested that we should pray a decade of the Rosary and ask for an open campsite. Just a few minutes after we finished, we found an almost empty campsite with amazing spots next to the lake! We were all surprised by how quickly our prayers were answered!
