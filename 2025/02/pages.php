					It's good to be back! Our students didn't start class 'til the 21st, but a lot has been going on! Over break we had the SEEK conference and a retreat with missionaries and students, and there's lots to share from starting the semester too!

			<h3>SEEK Conference</h3>
			<p class="text-medium">
				We began our new year in Salt Lake City for SEEK25! In 2020 my life was forever changed when I encountered Jesus' heart anew at a FOCUS conference, and I love to witness Him working in our students there. It was amazing getting to go to powerful talks, daily Mass, and Adoration with them. <a href="https://seekreplay.com/video/141" target="_blank">This</a> was one of my favorite talks!

			<h3>Missionary Summit</h3>
			<p class="text-medium">
				The weekend before the semester started, FOCUS invited us, our students, and other campuses to a retreat. It was a powerful time to reflect on being God's beloved children, and being fishers of men and going out into the deep to share the Gospel on campus. I got to catch up with some of the Air Force cadets there as well!

			<h3>Exodus 90</h3>
			<p class="text-medium">
				At SEEK, a lot of the men were inspired to start <a href="https://exodus90.com" target="_blank">Exodus 90</a>: a 90-day spiritual exercise of fasting, asceticism, and prayer leading up to Easter. I honestly didn't want to do it, but felt called to go through it with the guys this year - and I'm so glad I did. It has been especially cool to see their increased commitment to prayer and Mass - some of them have even started praying for an hour each day!

			<h3>Bible Studies</h3>
			<p class="text-medium">
				We have been praying for more student-led men's Bible studies at Mesa for a long time. Last semester we had our first one ever, and this semester we have 3 more starting! At SEEK, Barrett went to talks on leading a Bible study and came back excited to start his own! I'm so proud of him and grateful to God for this answered prayer.
