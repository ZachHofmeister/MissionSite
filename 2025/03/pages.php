				This year we've been focusing on calling our students, and ourselves, out of our comfort zone in campus outreach. For Valentine's Day, we handed out roses with Valentine's notes and invitations to Mesa Catholic. We had a lot more help from our students than normal, and had a lot of positive interactions with people through it!

				Towards the end of the month we had the Awakening retreat with our students. On the retreat we had Mass, Adoration, and confession, as well as lots of time listening to talks, and discussing how we can grow closer to the Lord. It was awesome to see students who went for the first time last year now giving talks and sharing their testimonies with new students!
