					I hope that you are doing well! This March was good, refreshing, and challenging all at the same time. Lent started, and our campus had spring break and a mission trip! I'm excited to share the joys and struggles of mission with you.

			<h3>Mission Trip</h3>
			<p class="text-medium">I was not part of the trip this year, but our students loved It! In Mexico, they got to teach catechism classes to kids, helped with a building project for a parish, and visited people in their homes to talk and pray with them. It was awesome to hear about it and see the impact it had, especially on Drew and Nick, who seem a little more outgoing!</p>

			<h3>The Path of Mission Ahead</h3>
			<p class="text-large">It's hard to believe, but we are about one month away from the end of the semester as I write this. This is my third year on mission with FOCUS, and it's been a difficult season of discerning where the Lord is calling me to go next year. Ultimately, I have decided I will be leaving staff with FOCUS this summer.</p>
			<p class="text-large">I'm going to miss being on mission full-time, the close relationships with my students, and my team life that helps me to be rooted in prayer and joy. At the same time, I am excited to find a job where I can use and develop my talents with technology, have a normal schedule as I prepare to be married in September, and learn to be on mission in my workplace and parish.</p>
			<p class="text-large">Preparing for this change has been really difficult for me, as I'm looking for what is to come and still trying to be fully engaged with the students the Lord has put in my life to share the Gospel with. At the same time, I am confident that it is the path the Lord is leading me on, and so it is good. Please pray for me to continue with confidence in Him, and to know how I can best witness to the Gospel in my time remaining.</p>
