				In our leadership Bible study, we have been teaching our students about knowing and sharing their testimonies and the Gospel with others! It was a joy to hear them share how the Lord has been calling them to Himself and to see their desire to witness to their faith!

			<h3>Discipleship Update</h3>
			<p class="text-large">
				This month, I shared the Gospel individually with Robert and Elijah and invited them into discipleship! In our recent weekly meetings I invited them to pray for 30 minutes every day, and we've been walking through how to build that habit together. Gabe and Drew received the same challenge and have been doing well in their prayer commitment, and I'm also very excited that they will be joining us at the SEEK conference over break! Please keep them all in your prayers!

			<h3>Bible Study</h3>
			<p class="text-large">
				My Bible study started walking through <a href="https://focusequip.org/salvation-history/" target="_blank">the Story of Salvation</a> study this month. The focus of the study is on God's relationship with man as seen in the stories of multiple biblical figures. So far, we have discussed the lives of Adam, Noah, and Abraham, and compared their journeys with God to our own. My favorite discussion so far has been reading about Abraham's journey from partial to complete faith in God, and talking about how we can take steps towards more complete faith also.

			<h3>Thanksgiving Break</h3>
			<p class="text-large">
				For Thanksgiving break I stayed in Grand Junction while my teammates and most of our students went home. My highlight of the break was having a really good conversation over breakfast with Keegan and going to pray with him afterwards. I also got to celebrate my birthday with some of my friends who stayed which was so fun!
