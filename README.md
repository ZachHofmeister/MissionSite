# MissionSite

MissionSite is my interactive newsletter platform that I use to create and share monthly newsletters to supporters of my work with FOCUS, the Fellowship of Catholic University Students.

## Why did I build a website?
It all started because I didn't like creating newsletters on Canva and I wanted to see if I could make a website with pages that could be printed out and sent via paper as well as digitally. It is a fun project for me to work on in my free time to keep my web development skills sharp, and I enjoy coming up with new features and improving the site. Plus, I love that my mission partners can click on a photo and see it bigger in a lightbox, or that I can link to spiritual resources and Bible passages!

## How is it designed?
First I built the front-end of the website with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. That was functional enough to design and share newsletters, but I wanted to give it a back-end to add more automation. I converted the site to **PHP** and created a **MariaDB** database to store information on the newsletters.

## What are you interested in improving?
So much. I've thought at some points that it would be cool to make this completely modular or a wordpress template or something, so that other missionaries could build and send their own interactive newsletters. Here are some of the ideas that I'm most interested in adding as I progress to that possibility:

* Creating / integrating a **newsletter builder**, so I don't have to code the newsletters in HTML in an editor. In the **Users** branch you can store newsletters in the database rather than hardcoded PHP, but it's just a text field to edit them.
* Adding **videos**
* Adding a **comment section**
* Adding a way to **sign up for my mailing list**
