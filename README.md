# MissionSite

MissionSite is my newsletter platform that I use to host and distribute monthly newsletters to supporters of my work with FOCUS, the Fellowship of Catholic University Students. It all started because I didn't like creating newsletters on Canva and I wanted to see if I could make a website with pages that could be printed out and sent via paper as well as digitally. It is a fun project for me to work on in my free time to keep my web development skills sharp, and I enjoy coming up with new features and improving the site.
