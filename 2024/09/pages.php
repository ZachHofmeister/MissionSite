			<h3>Welcome Retreat</h3>
			<p class="text-medium">
				Midway through September we had our Welcome retreat. It was a great opportunity for all of us to slow down, set aside distractions to pray, and grow in fellowship. Fr. Carl offered the Mass, we hiked and prayed the rosary, and Joe and I gave a talk to the men on <a href="https://www.usccb.org/topics/youth-and-young-adult-ministries/blessed-pier-giorgio-frassati" target="_blank">Bl. Pier Giorgio</a> and making Christ the focus of our lives.

			<h3>Bible Studies</h3>

				We've had three men's Bible studies going so far - one of them being led by a student which is a first for our campus! My Bible study has a mixture of new guys and ones from last year, and we've just finished <a href="https://focusequip.org/the-crux-2020/" target="_blank">the Crux</a> - a Bible study on the Gospel message, knowing the heart of God for us, and responding to Him.

			<h3>Discipleship Update</h3>
			<p class="text-medium">
				I am leading the same 7 guys in discipleship and overjoyed by the ways they are living out their faith more deeply than ever before. I am coaching 4 of them to start their own Bible studies, and I see all of them regularly coming to the chapel to spend time with our Lord. At Easter, 2 of them will be confirmed and 1 will be entering the Church! Praise God!<br>
				One of my favorite moments was combining both groups to discuss and model sharing our testimonies, and then hearing all of them share with the group. Some were nervous, but they shared from their hearts and it was so beautiful to hear concretely how the Lord has worked and is working in their lives. I am so excited for them to share their stories on campus.

				Michelle Duppong was a farmgirl from North Dakota who had a deep awareness of Christ's love and thirst for us and lived completely for Him, to her death at the age of 31. She has had a huge impact on how I live mission, and I will be seeing it with students in November. Her life will inspire you as well! It's in theaters nationwide for one night only this may be the only opportunity to watch it for a while! Click the image for more information.
