				It was so good to experience SEEK anew through the eyes of our students! I spent most of my time with the men going to talks they were interested in, but it was also so freeing to break away occasionally to spend time with Jesus in Adoration and prayer.

				Through the talks, my conversations, and my prayer at SEEK this year, the Lord has sparked a fire in my heart to reach the men of our campus through the message of authentic masculinity. God has given men the great opportunity to become living images of the Father in their love, and I am so excited to explore and share this more!

				The Saturday before classes began there was a small club fair, so we brought donuts and event flyers to meet and invite new students. My highlight this day was running into Minhtam, a friend of Gabe and Drew I'd met once last semester, and inviting him to a game night that week - he came!
