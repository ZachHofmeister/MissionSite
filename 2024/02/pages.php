			<h3>(Early) St. Valentine's Day</h3>
			<p class="text-large">
				Since Valentine's Day overlapped with Ash Wednesday this year, we celebrated it early by giving out roses with mass info for the next day! The students were really grateful for the roses, and people started coming to us because of their friends telling them too!

				On Ash Wednesday we had two masses on campus, and manned a table all day to tell people about them. We answered a lot of people on campus confused about why we were calling Valentine's day Ash Wednesday or wondering what it was about, and we had about 80 students total come to mass!

				At the end of the month we went on a weekend retreat led by our student leaders. They did a good job giving talks and sharing their testimonies, and Fr. Carl, a young priest, came to give us Mass, Adoration, and confession! It was great that most of my Bible study came!
