				The people we served in Peru live in Pamplona Alta, a mountainous neighborhood on the outskirts of Lima. Our neighbors there were mostly immigrants seeking a better future for their families, even though their living conditions were heartbreaking.

				Each day we also got to accompany our students in daily mass and praying a daily holy hour. This was something new to many of them, and we got to hear some of the awesome and small ways they were encountering the Lord and receiving the grace and strength they needed to continue when being on mission was hard. I certainly needed it! We also got to bring prayer to our neighbors in Pamplona, celebrating mass there our first Sunday and having adoration during our work one day. It was beautiful to join with them in the celebration of the faith!

				We took one day to visit where St. Rose of Lima, St. Martin de Porres, St. John Macias, and other holy men and women lived and poured their lives out for Jesus and the poor. It was very inspiring to learn more about their discipleship and continue in their work in a little way.
