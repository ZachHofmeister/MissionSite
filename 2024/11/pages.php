			<h3>Bible Study Wrap-Ups</h3>
			<p class="text-medium">
				After finishing the Crux, I started the <a href="https://focusequip.org/life-in-christ/" target="_blank">Life in Christ</a> Bible study with my group. So far, we've been talking about what it means to call ourselves disciples in the modern day, and how we practice discipleship through prayer and fellowship. I also shared the Gospel with Dylan and John over lunch, and invited them to enter discipleship too!

				In our discipleship meetings, I invited 3 more guys to take seriously Christ's call for us to be on mission with Him, and to do that through intentional friendship and starting Bible studies. Gabe, Drew, Barrett, and Nick will be preparing to start their own studies next semester over the break! I'm so excited for them to take this big step!

			<h3>Recruitment Weekend</h3>

				I got to help with a FOCUS recruitment weekend in November, and it was so rejuvenating. This year has honestly been stressful for me, and it was great to take a step back, see friends, talk with people discerning God's call to mission, and pray in a refreshed way. The Lord gave me a lot of peace and clarity in prayer that weekend!

				This Advent I've been praying with preparation for Christ's coming at the end of our lives and the world, and talking about that with our students (see verse above). We're also having an Upper Room meeting over break with our disciples to encourage them in this. I'm also excited for the SEEK conference with them in January!

				If you didn't get a chance to see the incredible <a href="https://focus.org/michelleduppong/" target="_blank">documentary about the servant of God Michelle Duppong</a>, or want to share it with family this Christmas, it is now available to stream on EWTN for free! Michelle Duppong entered eternal life on December 25, 2015. This is a great advent movie to prepare ourselves if Christ calls us also to stand before Him this Christmas. I hope you get the chance to watch it!
